Lecture 15 The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
Reading: Sections 8.1 - 8.6 in Oppenheim, Schafer & Buck (OSB).

Here are some basic points about the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the discrete-time Fourier Transform (DTFT), and the fast Fourier transform (FFT):
1. The DTFT can’t be computed.
2. The DFT can be computed.
3. The DFT isn’t the DTFT.
4. The FFT isn’t the DFT.
5. The FFT is not necessarily the best/most efficient way to compute whatever it is that it computes.

In this lecture, we will cover the first three points, and discuss the FFT in lecture 19.

## Sampling in Frequency

The DTFT of \( x[n] \) is defined as follows:
\[ X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\omega n} \]

Since \(\omega\) is a continuous variable, there are an infinite number of possible values of \(\omega\) from 0 to \(2\pi\) or from \(-\pi\) to \(\pi\). Thus, \(X(e^{j\omega})\) can be computed only at a finite set of frequencies:
\[ X(e^{j\omega_k}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\omega_k n} \]

As a special case, we use N samples equally spaced around the unit circle:
\[ \omega_k = \frac{2\pi k}{N}, \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \]
and define the N samples of \(X(e^{j\omega})\):
\[ X[k] = X(e^{j\omega})|_{\omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N}} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\frac{2\pi k n}{N}} \]

For convenience in notation, we define:
\[ W_N = e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}} \]
then
\[ X[k] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] W_N^{nk} \]

However, we still cannot compute \(X[k]\) since \(x[n]\) can be infinitely long and we are summing for all \(n\). Even if \(x[n]\) is finite, we cannot always recover \(x[n]\) perfectly from \(X[k]\) because \(X[k]\)s are essentially the samples of the DTFT. So there are some necessary conditions for which we will be able to recover \(x[n]\) from \(X[k]\).

In order to find these conditions, first speculate the sampling theorem in the continuous-time domain:

[IMAGE_BLOCK_1]

The image displays two pairs of time-domain signals and their corresponding frequency-domain Fourier transforms, illustrating the effect of sampling on signal spectra. The top pair shows a continuous-time signal \(x_c(t)\) (smooth, bandlimited waveform) and its Fourier transform \(X_c(j\Omega)\), a triangular spectrum centered at zero with bandwidth \(\Omega_n\) and peak amplitude 1. The bottom pair shows a sampled version \(x_s(t)\) (impulse train modulated by the original signal, with sampling interval \(\Delta T\)) and its Fourier transform \(X_s(j\Omega)\), which consists of periodic replicas of the original triangular spectrum spaced by \(\frac{2\pi}{\Delta T}\), each scaled by \(\frac{1}{\Delta T}\). Arrows indicate the Fourier transform relationship between each time- and frequency-domain pair.

Sampling in time corresponds to replication in the frequency domain. In order to recover \(X_c(j\Omega)\) perfectly by low-pass filtering \(X_s(j\Omega)\), frequency aliasing should be avoided. Therefore, \(x(t)\) should be bandlimited to \(\Omega_0\), and the sampling interval should be short enough so that:
\[ \Delta T < \frac{2\pi}{\Omega_0} \]

We can apply the time-frequency duality to illustrate the sampling process in the frequency domain. If the sampling interval in frequency is not short enough, we get time aliasing....

  文本: sampling interval in the frequency domain is ΔΩ, it corresponds to replication of signals in time domain at every 2π/ΔΩ. In order to recover $x(t)$ from $\tilde{x}(t)$ by time windowing, $x(t)$ should be time-limited to $T_0$, and sampling interval should be small enough so that
\[ 2\pi \Delta\Omega < T_0 \]
We have basically the same result in the discrete-time domain.

[IMAGE_BLOCK_2]

The image displays two pairs of time-domain discrete signals and their corresponding frequency-domain representations (DTFT magnitude plots), illustrating the effect of signal periodic extension on spectral resolution. The top pair shows a finite-length sequence \( x[n] \) of length \( M \) (nonzero from \( n=0 \) to \( n=M \)) and its DTFT \( X(e^{j\omega}) \), which is continuous, periodic with period \( 2\pi \), and exhibits main lobe and sidelobes. The bottom pair shows a periodically extended version \( \tilde{x}[n] \) formed by repeating \( x[n] \) with period \( N = 2\pi/\Delta\omega \), where \( \Delta\omega \) is the frequency spacing between spectral lines; its DTFT consists of discrete samples (impulses) at multiples of \( \Delta\omega \), forming a line spectrum that aligns with the original DTFT envelope. Arrows indicate the Fourier transform relationship between time and frequency domains in both cases.

The sampling interval \( \Delta\omega \) should satisfy the following condition:
\[ 2\pi \Delta\omega < M \]
If we denote the number of frequency samples from 0 to \( 2\pi \) as \( N \), it is required that
\[ 2\pi / N > \Delta\omega \]
Under this condition, \( x[n] \) can be perfectly recovered from the samples of the DTFT:
\[ x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] W_N^{-nk}, \quad n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \]

### The Discrete Fourier Series

Let \( \tilde{x}[n] \) be a periodic signal with period \( N \) (We will use \( \tilde{} \) to denote periodic signals). Consider representing this signal by a Fourier series corresponding to a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials \( e^{j\omega n} \), where \( \omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N} \).

\[ e_k[n] = e^{j \frac{2\pi k}{N} n} \]

Notice that
\[ e_k[n] = e_{k+N}[n] \]

Therefore, the Fourier series of a discrete-time periodic signal \( \tilde{x}[n] \) only requires \( N \) complex exponentials, so it has the form
\[ \tilde{x}[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] e^{-j \frac{2\pi k}{N} n} \]

Here, \( \frac{1}{N} \) is included in the definition for convenience in future. To obtain \( \tilde{X}[k] \) from \( \tilde{x}[n] \),
\[ \tilde{X}[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \tilde{x}[n] e^{j \frac{2\pi k}{N} n} \]
which can be verified by direct substitution. Thus, \( \tilde{x}[n] \) is periodic in \( n \) with period \( N \), and \( \tilde{X}[k] \) is periodic in \( k \) with period \( N \).

Consider two periodic sequences \( \tilde{x}[n] \) and \( \tilde{y}[n] \) both with period \( N \), such that
\[ \tilde{x}[n] \leftrightarrow \tilde{X}[k] \]
and
\[ \tilde{y}[n] \leftrightarrow \tilde{Y}[k] \]

OSB Figure 8.3 illustrates the periodic convolution of two periodic sequences. Note that as the sequences \( \tilde{x}_2[n-m] \) shifts to the right or left, values that leave the interval between the dotted lines at one end reappear at the other end because of the periodicity.

The periodic convolution of periodic sequences corresponds to multiplication of the corresponding periodic sequences of Fourier series coefficients.
\[ \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \tilde{x}[m] \tilde{y}[n-m] \leftrightarrow \tilde{X}[k] \tilde{Y}[k] \]

Other properties of the DFS are discussed in OSB section 5.2.

### The Discrete Fourier Transform

Consider a finite sequence \( x[n] \) with length \( N \), which is zero except at \( n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \). Then, we can think about extending this sequence into a periodic sequence of period \( N \).
\[ \tilde{x}[n] = x[n + rN] = x[n \mod N] = x((n)_N) \]

  文本: As long as there is no time aliasing, we can recover $x[n]$ perfectly from $\tilde{x}[n]$. 
\[
\tilde{x}[n] = x[n]R_N[n],
\]
where $R_N[n]$ is a rectangular window:
\[
R_N[n] = \begin{cases} 
1 & n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
The discrete Fourier transform of a finite sequence $x[n]$ is defined as the discrete Fourier series of $\tilde{x}[n]$. 
\[
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]W_N^{nk}, \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1
\]
\[
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k]W_N^{-nk}, \quad n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1
\]
Consider a finite-duration sequence shown in OSB Figure 8.10(a). If we consider $x[n]$ as a sequence of length $N = 5$, the corresponding periodic sequence is $\tilde{x}[n]$ in OSB Figure 8.10(b). The Fourier series coefficients for $\tilde{x}[n]$ are shown in OSB Figure 8.10(c). To emphasize that the Fourier series coefficients are samples of the Fourier transform, $|X(e^{j\omega})|$ is also shown. The 5-point DFT $X[k]$ corresponds to one period of $\tilde{X}[k]$, as shown in OSB Figure 8.10(d).

If we consider $x[n]$ to be a sequence of length $N = 10$, however, we get completely different DFT values. The corresponding periodic sequence $\tilde{x}[n]$ is shown in OSB Figure 8.11(b). The 10-point DFT $X[k]$ is shown in OSB Figure 8.11(c) and (d).

We can interpret the relationship between a finite-length sequence $x[n]$ and a periodic sequence $\tilde{x}[n]$ by displaying $x[n]$ around the circumference of a cylinder with a circumference of exactly $N$ points. As we repeatedly traverse the circumference of the cylinder, the sequence that we see is the periodic sequence $\tilde{x}[n]$. Then, a linear shift of this sequence corresponds to a rotation of the cylinder. Such a shift is called a circular shift, which is illustrated in OSB Figure 8.12.

A circular shift in time results in multiplying the DFT of the sequence by a linear phase factor.
[IMAGE_BLOCK_3]
\[
x [ ( ( n-m ) )_{N} ] , \ \ \ 0 \leq n \leq N-1 \ \ \leftrightarrow\ \ e^{-j ( 2 \pi k / N ) m} X [ k ]
\]

Consider two finite-duration sequences $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$, both of length $N$, with DFTs $X_1[k]$ and $X_2[k]$, respectively. Then, $X_3[k] = X_1[k]X_2[k]$ corresponds to the DFT of the $N$-point circular convolution of $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$, defined as follows:
[IMAGE_BLOCK_4]
\[
x_{3} [ n ]=\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x_{1} [ m ] x_{2} [ ( ( n-m ) )_{N} ] , \ \quad0 \leq n \leq N-1 .
\]
OSB Figure 8.14 illustrates the circular convolution of two finite-length sequences.

## Summary
1. $x[n]$ arbitrary length DTFT $X(e^{j\omega}) \leftrightarrow$
\[
X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j\omega n}
\]
2. $x[n]$ periodic DFS $\tilde{X}[k] \leftrightarrow$
\[
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]W_N^{nk}, \quad W_N = e^{-j \frac{2\pi}{N}}
\]
\[
X[k] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]R_N[n]W_N^{nk} = \text{DTFT}\{\tilde{x}[n]R_N[n]\}|_{\omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N}}
\]
3. $x[n]$ finite length (0, 1, ..., N-1) DFT $X[k] \leftrightarrow$
\[
\tilde{x}[n] = x[(n)_N] = \sum_{r} x[n + rN]
\]
\[
x[n] = \tilde{x}[n]R_N[n]
\]
\[
\text{DFT of } x[n] = \text{DFS of } x[(n)_N] = \text{DTFT}\{x[n]\}|_{\omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N}}
\]

The following figure summarizes this lecture.
[IMAGE_BLOCK_5]
The diagram illustrates relationships among signal representations and transforms: a finite-length signal $x[n]$ connects to its DTFT $X(e^{j\omega})$ (continuous-frequency spectrum), which samples to the DFT $X[k]$; the DFT is also linked to a periodic extension $\tilde{x}[n]$ (periodic sequence), whose DFS yields $\tilde{X}[k]$. Bidirectional arrows indicate equivalence or invertibility between $x[n]$ and $\tilde{x}[n]$, and between $X[k]$ and $\tilde{X}[k]$, emphasizing that DFT and DFS are discrete, periodic counterparts of DTFT and Fourier series for finite/periodic sequences.
